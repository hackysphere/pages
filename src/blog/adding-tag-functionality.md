You can now find posts that I make using tags! A view of all tags that were added to posts is available [here](/blog/tags), and you can filter posts by individual tags. I might make tags have their own RSS feeds as well.

Posts now also show tags <span style="color: var(--tag-color); background-color: var(--bg-color-darkened)">in blue</span> by the post metadata, and on post cards!

This was quicker to implement than I thought, and most of the time was spent on making the tags buttons look nice.
