I have finally made the repo for this blog public, so you can view the code that makes this website work.  
  
You probably shouldn't learn from any of the code for this, though, as I have taken multiple multi-month breaks, and some code could have been done better.  
  
This website is licensed under MIT, so you should be okay with using any of this in your projects, although I would recommend trying to make all of your website components yourself, and just using the code from here to get inspiration and reference on how to do some complex things (ex: filtering a content collection by tags).
