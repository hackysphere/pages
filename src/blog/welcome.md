I've been wanting to make a blog, and recently I found out about [Astro](https://astro.build), which lets me use plain HTML for most content, letting me make a website easily!

I'll be posting guides, resources, and whatever else I feel like should be a blog post.

You can also subscribe to this blog with an RSS reader using the link on the [blog homepage](/blog). Don't except frequent posts, though! A tag view is available at [/blog/tags](/blog/tags) ~~(page is very incomplete as of writing, but still functional)~~.

This blog still isn't completely done, but I will open-source it once the main features I want are implemented. Even though the licenses at the bottom lead to 404 pages, they still apply as of right now (this post **is** CC-BY 4.0).
